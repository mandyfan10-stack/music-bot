## 2024-05-30 - Fix reverse tabnabbing vulnerability
**Vulnerability:** External links were opened using `window.open(url.href, '_blank')` without specifying `noopener,noreferrer`.
**Learning:** This exposes the application to reverse tabnabbing, allowing the opened page to potentially redirect the original page to a malicious site.
**Prevention:** Always use `'noopener,noreferrer'` in the third argument of `window.open` when opening external URLs with `_blank`.

## 2025-02-23 - Prevent DOM XSS in inline JS event handlers due to unescaped single quotes
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled values dynamically embedded into inline JS event handlers in HTML attributes (e.g. `onerror="this.src='${fb}'"`) were vulnerable to DOM XSS because `encodeURIComponent` (used to sanitize `fb`) does not escape single quotes (`'`). This allows an attacker to break out of the string context and execute arbitrary JavaScript.
**Learning:** `encodeURIComponent` does not provide sufficient escaping for single quotes when the resulting string is embedded within a single-quoted JavaScript string inside an HTML attribute.
**Prevention:** Always use `escapeJsHtml()` when interpolating variables into inline JavaScript handlers (like `onclick`, `onerror`, etc.) to properly escape JS special characters and prevent string breakout.

## 2025-02-23 - Prevent DOM XSS when injecting external API data via innerHTML
**Vulnerability:** In `handleAddRelease()`, the application fetched data from external APIs (oEmbed, iTunes, etc.) and injected `parsedCover` directly into the DOM using `innerHTML` without escaping. An attacker could potentially return malicious payloads containing double quotes to break out of the `src` attribute context and inject executable code (DOM XSS).
**Learning:** Even data from seemingly trusted or well-known APIs (like oEmbed or iTunes) must be treated as untrusted. Injecting external API data directly into `innerHTML` is dangerous.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize/escape external data using `escapeHtml()` before injecting it into the DOM via `innerHTML`, even if the data originates from a "trusted" external source.

## 2026-05-05 - Fix path traversal vulnerabilities in DELETE requests
**Vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerabilities in the `executeDeleteReview()` and `executeDeleteRelease()` functions. Variables used to construct the DELETE request path (`pendingReviewDelete` and `releaseToDelete`) were not URL-encoded.
**Learning:** Even internal ID values handled by the frontend can be manipulated by malicious actors to construct unintended API paths if they aren't properly sanitized. For example, if an ID is set to `../users/1`, a request to `/api/reviews/${id}` could be manipulated to target `/api/users/1`.
**Prevention:** Always use `encodeURIComponent()` when dynamically embedding variables into the path of a URL, even if the values are expected to be simple IDs.
